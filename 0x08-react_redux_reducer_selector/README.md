# React Redux Reducer + Selector

This project focuses on implementing Redux reducers and selectors using React. It covers the use of Immutable.js for managing state immutability, Normalizr for normalizing state shape, and writing tests to ensure the correctness of the implementations.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will gain a solid understanding of the following concepts:

- Redux reducers and selectors
- The importance of maintaining state immutability
- Normalizing state shape using Normalizr
- Writing tests for Redux reducers and selectors
- Using Immutable.js for efficient state management

## Tasks Overview

The project is divided into several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of Redux implementation:

1. **Write a basic reducer**: Implement a basic Redux reducer for managing UI state.

2. **Use Immutable for the UI Reducer**: Refactor the UI reducer to use Immutable.js for immutable state management.

3. **Create a reducer for Courses**: Implement a Redux reducer for managing course-related state.

4. **Create the reducer for notifications**: Implement a Redux reducer for managing notifications state.

5. **Selectors**: Implement selectors for accessing data from the Redux state efficiently.
